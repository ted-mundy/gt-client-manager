### Manage different game clients and server connections

# About

(Eventually), this will be a desktop executable which will handle all connections to private servers and instances of the game client.
Currently, if you were to be a member of more than one private server, you'd have to keep changing your `hosts` file. This aims to remove this aspect,
and (eventually) will include a server list, which will allow you to join public servers at the push of a button, each with a (maybe?) sandboxed game client.

Obviously all subject to change. I have very little idea about how the game works (I know you don't want your `save.dat` stolen, unsure as to why), but this
will either be helped out by the community, or I will just learn it myself.

Still a few things to be ironed out, but to make this very clear, **this application is not targeted towards botfarm owners/operators**, this is quite simply
just a client manager. You won't be able to spin up 100s of the same game client on the same machine (even then, would the game even let you on?), you'll have to
go elsewhere for that.

Also a good excuse to learn Tauri.
