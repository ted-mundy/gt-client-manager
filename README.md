### Manage different game clients and server connections

# About

(Eventually), this will be a desktop executable which will handle all connections to private servers and instances of the game client.
Currently, if you were to be a member of more than one private server, you'd have to keep changing your `hosts` file. This aims to remove this aspect,
and (eventually) will include a server list, which will allow you to join public servers at the push of a button, each with a (maybe?) sandboxed game client.

Obviously all subject to change. I have very little idea about how the game works (I know you don't want your `save.dat` stolen, unsure as to why), but this
will either be helped out by the community, or I will just learn it myself.

Also a good excuse to learn Tauri.
